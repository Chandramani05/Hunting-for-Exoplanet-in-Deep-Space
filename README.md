# Hunting-for-Exoplanet-in-Deep-Space

Since many ages ago, only astronomy professionals
and researchers have been
able to identify planets with the aid of
sophisticated tools. This pattern has changed
with the development of computational techniques
and the availability of satellite data from
space missions. For example, the Exoplanet
Exploration [1] program of NASA has given
us access to a wealth of information on celestial
bodies to aid in space exploration. The
Kepler mission is one such intriguing mission.
Since the missionâ€™s inception in 2007, more
than 4000 such transiting exoplanets have been
found, recognized, and cataloged. It concentrated
on learning about planets and planetary
systems.Four fundamental models have been
explored. Specifically, XgBoost, Deep Neural
Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Random
Forest Classifiers. The XgBoost classifier,
which produced an F-1 score of 98% on the
dataset, was chosen as the best machine learning
model.
Investigated performance of SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network and Boosting Algorithm XGBoost on classification
of the exoplanet. Used K means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to separate 7 out of 8 different kinds of
planets.
